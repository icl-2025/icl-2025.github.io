## Installation procedures

### The Coq proof assistant

The Coq proof assistant is going to be our tool of choice for the
first part of the CVS course.

In order to install Coq, I advise you to use the *Coq Platform*. The
platform main repository and documentation is
[here](https://github.com/coq/platform). There, you will found
instructions on how to install Coq under Linux, Windows, or Mac.

Regarding editors, Coq comes with its own IDE. This is installed with
the Coq Platform. There are also very smooth integration of the proof
assistant with common text editors, such as VS Code.
