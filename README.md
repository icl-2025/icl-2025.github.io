## Installation procedures

### The OCaml language and ecosystem

The OCaml language is our tool of choice for the most part of the ICL
course. We are going to use OCaml during lectures, to present
fundamental concepts about languages and compilers, as well as in
practical sessions to implement and experiment with some of the main
concepts presented during lectures.

In order to install OCaml and the language ecosystem, please follow
the installation guide provided [here](install_ocaml).
